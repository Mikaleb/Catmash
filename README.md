## Exercise

A webapp that shows you two pictures of cats, you select one, data is saved locally. There is a dashboard to see the ones you voted the most.

Since the API only handle a get parameter, we're going to store the data locally.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
